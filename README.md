# Fanta-Manta

Resurrection of the Manta closed source pcb by rainkeebs using Waveshare RP2040 zero.
Generously sponsored by jcastaneda from MechWild discord.

I did the design as closely to the originaly rainkeebs design as much as possible with the difference of using a RP2040 instead of Pro Micro.
This design resurrection was blessed by rainkeebs himself.
PCBs are currently in production. 1 Aug 2023.
